description: Very first blog post that I've written for one of the previous revisions of my website. Not fun. Don't open.

This is the original introduction I wrote long time ago for the v1 of my blog. Decided to keep it just to mark the epoch :)

My name is Igor Starostenko and I would like to introduce you my renewed website! A long time have passed since I've decided to start writing down my thoughts and things that happen to me and finally I am happy to begin this blog. Unfortunately I am neither a writer nor I have a journalist education, but I am willing to share some of my experience, that can be usefull to someone or at least interesting to read:)
