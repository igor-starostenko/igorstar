description: A short story about our fight with evil and filth on the biggest annual costume party in the world.
---
For two days the clouds were gathering. Few believed that the rain will come to LA, and perhaps it would not come if not the interference of dark forces who organized the world's largest procession in honor of All Hallows day.

Traditionally Halloween Carnival in West Holywood raises about 500 thousand living dead along Santa Monica boulevard.

Of course, me and my wife, as keepers of the light force could not stand aside and took the fight with the evil. We overpassed the entire route to record our courage on camera ðŸ˜¨.
Unfortunately the end of the story was not like in a typical fairy tale. The Dark Lord triumphed, having washed us with pouring rain ðŸ˜„.
